## Description
This forum is aimed towards technology students and other tech invested people interested in starting a discussion with their fellow programmers. Where stack-overflow aims towards problem solving, this will aim to a more casual approach, chatting and sharing your information, finding people with skills you could need for a project etc.

### My users
- Larissa She's a visually impaired CMD student, who might be intrested in being able to discuss technology on a 'visually impaired friendly' forum
- Dennis The "average joe" back-ender. Enjoys flashy designs together with clear clickable interfaces.

## Components
- Threads
    - thread responses  
    Making it easy and quick to respond, with seeing instant feedback could increase the engagement of the average user.
    - Ability to create new threads  
    This should be as clear as possible without it being the primairy vocal point. Somewhere above the list of threads.
- Users
    - Users Profile  
    Being able to see atleast people their description and offline/online status at all times could create a stimuli for users to engage in a discussion faster.
    - gebruiker list 
    This one seems like 'just extra data'. Debatable wheter it's needed.
- Messages
    - liked messages  
    Being able to influence the overall sentiment around a message should be reflected in that these messages will be easier to find.
    - Start messages of a thread  
    These messages are really important, they dictate the direction of the discussion. It might be valueable to append messages to the card of the 'thread list'
- Categories  
  Making categories easy to browse and insightful without it visually overloading users could help them to narrow their search rather quickly.

## views
- Threads
    - Detail view  
    Decided to go more towards the direction of a single page web app for this one, folding it out when you click on a thread from the thread list
