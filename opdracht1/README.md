## Introduction
![](https://i.gyazo.com/cd044aa8937f62eb2e50318022796511.gif)

This project features a "Inspiration" photo gallery. The main focus is to source for pictures to use in web-designs, or just look at projects other people made. 

## Features 
- A landing page with "sliding" possibilities that acts as a focal point
- Indicative animations to improve the understanding by the user what actions are possible
- A detail view for projects to gain more insight on what to do

## Wishlist
- Solve the fetch issues
- Work with more animations
- Give the detail page some more love like who created the post
- the possibility for someone to create a post

## Three principles
As part of the assignment, we had to select three principles from [this](http://bokardo.com/principles-of-user-interface-design/) article, my choices were:
- Consistency Matters
- Strong visual hierarchies work best
- Clairy is job #1
These principles have resulted in a rather unique design.

### Consistency Matters
This pattern in particulair actually helped me settle on a design, as it forced me to try and reuse variables like margins/paddings to make the website feel more consistent. This is true in particulair for the detail view, where i reused the design of the Landing page slider to make the transistion feel quite fluid. As part of being consistent i also tried to not overdo, and have some natural inconsitency like size of image cards depending on their dimensions to create a effect that appeals to the eye.

### Strong visual hierarchies work best
This pattern has been introduced by making use Different fonts, different font-size's and shadow's which try to lure attention to the more important content, for example the card design has a quite eye catching purple fab to encourage the visitor to visit the detailpage. Making it close to the bold title i hope it draws attention to that aswell. I've really tried to put allot of thought in what works, especially in the landing page where i've used text over the image, which is quite challeging in itself. here i tried to put the text boxes in the generally more "empty" spaces of a photo, and also put more emphasis on it with some additional styling.

### Clarity is #1
By using animations and like, i pointed out above, elements like a FAB i believe i've created a interface that's quite easy to understand and use.
